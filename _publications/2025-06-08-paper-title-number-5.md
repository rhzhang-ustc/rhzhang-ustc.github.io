We present **PneuGelSight**, a novel pneumatic soft robotic manipulator that embeds a camera for **high-resolution tactile sensing and proprioception**. To fully exploit the sensor’s capabilities, we develop an **optical–mechanical simulation pipeline** that models both light transport and soft-body dynamics, enabling **zero-shot transfer from simulation to real-world tasks**.  

Our results show that PneuGelSight provides **robust, accurate, and easily deployable sensing** for soft robots, paving the way toward more capable and sensorized soft robotic systems.
