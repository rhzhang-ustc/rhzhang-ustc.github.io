# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ruohan Zhang å¼ è‹¥æ¶µ

I am a **Ph.D. student in Robotics** at the [University of Illinois Urbanaâ€“Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SNqm6doAAAAJ&hl=en/) in the [RoboTouch Lab](https://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/).  

Before joining UIUC, I earned my **B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering and Information Science** at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I graduated with the **Guo Moruo Scholarship**, the highest honor for undergraduates at USTC (awarded to ~1 student per major).

My research lies at the intersection of **robot perception, tactile sensing, and active manipulation**. I design and study vision-based tactile sensors and their integration into robotic end-effectors, with the goal of enabling robots to interact delicately and intelligently with the physical world.


## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- Active perception and contact-rich manipulation  
- Vision-based tactile sensing
- Physics-based control and embodied intelligence
