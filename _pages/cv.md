Research Experience
======
* **Towards Scalable and Damageless Harvesting: A Sensorized Gripper with In-Hand Tactile Perception**  
  RoboTouch Lab, UIUC · Oct. 2024 – Aug. 2025  
  - Designed and fabricated compact optical-mechanical components enabling seamless integration of sensing and actuation.  
  - Developed a ROS-based real-time control pipeline (25 Hz) with tactile algorithms for force prediction (R² = 0.95), slip detection (F1 = 0.69, ~110 ms early warning), and fruit softness estimation (94.6% accuracy).  
  - Integrated perception modules into a unified pipeline, achieving 100% grasp success with ±0.1 N force variation in agricultural trials.  
  - Work under review at *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)*.  

* **Vision-based Proprioception and Tactile Sensing for Soft Robotics**  
  RoboTouch Lab, UIUC · Sept. 2023 – Sept. 2024  
  - Developed an embedded-camera pipeline enabling sub-millimeter tactile reconstruction of contact surfaces using photometric stereo and deep learning.  
  - Implemented real-time proprioception algorithms for soft grippers, allowing precise geometry reconstruction with latency under 40 ms.  
  - Published in *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2025*; presented as a keynote talk at ICRA 2025.  

* **Design and Innovation of Quadrotor UAV**  
  USTC · Mar. – Jul. 2021  
  - Built a quadrotor UAV from scratch, achieving stable hovering within ±3 cm drift.  
  - Designed logic control circuits, power management systems, and optimized flight algorithms.  
  - Implemented real-time parameter adjustments, improving response time and flight speed.
