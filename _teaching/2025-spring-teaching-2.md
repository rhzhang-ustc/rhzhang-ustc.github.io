I served as a Teaching Assistant for this course, helping lead labs and support students in mastering fundamental concepts of circuit analysis and electronics. Topics covered include:

- Basic principles of circuit analysis: Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws, node-voltage and mesh-current methods  
- Transient and steady-state behavior of linear circuits (RC, RL, first- & second-order systems)  
- AC analysis using phasors, frequency response, filters  
- Introduction to semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, op-amps  
- Logic gates, digital logic circuits  

I assisted with grading lab reports, holding office hours, and helping students troubleshoot their experiments to reinforce hands-on understanding of electronics theory.
