I served as a Teaching Assistant for this course, helping lead labs and support students in mastering fundamental concepts of circuit analysis and electronics. Topics covered include:

- Basic measurement techniques and instrumentation  
- Electric circuits and transient response  
- Transistor amplifiers and switching circuits  
- Operational amplifiers, voltage regulators  
- DC motor control and feedback systems  
- Logic circuits (CMOS, DTL, TTL)  

I assisted with grading lab reports, holding office hours, and helping students troubleshoot their experiments to reinforce hands-on understanding of electronics theory.
